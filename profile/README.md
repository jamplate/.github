### Jamplate Project 

Jamplate Project is a general purpose compiler toolkit.

Its goal is to make lexecal analysis easer to maintain 
and read while supporting any feature a language might need.

It achieves that by adopting a plugin/componenet based system
where every grammer/rule has its own lexer that can work 
independently from any other lexer.
